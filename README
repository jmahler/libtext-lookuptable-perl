NAME
    Text::LookUpTable - Perl5 module for text based look up table operations

SYNOPSIS
      $tbl = Text::LookUpTable->load_file('my_table.tbl');
      $tbl = Text::LookUpTable->load($str_tbl);
      $tbl = Text::LookUpTable->load_blank($x_size, $y_size, $x_title, $y_title);

      print $tbl;
      $str_tbl = "$tbl";

      $tbl->save_file();
      $tbl->save_file('my_table.tbl');

      $tbl->set($x, $y, $val);

      @diff_coords = $tbl->diff($tbl2);
      $diffp = $tbl->diff($tbl2, 1);  # true/false no coordinates

      @xdiffs = $tb1->diff_x_coords($tb2);
      @ydiffs = $tb1->diff_y_coords($tb2);

      @x_coords = $tbl->get_x_coords();
      @y_coords = $tbl->get_y_coords();

      $res = $tbl->set_x_coords(@x_coords);
      $res = $tbl->set_y_coords(@y_coords);

      @ys = $tbl->get_y_vals($x_offset);
      @xs = $tbl->get_x_vals($y_offset);

      $str_plot = $tbl->as_plot('R');
      print FILE $str_plot;

DESCRIPTION
    Text::LookUpTable provides operations for creating, storing, displaying,
    plotting, loading, and querying a *look up table* structure. The format
    of the stored structure is designed to be visually easy to understand so
    that it can be easily edited using a text editor.

    The authors inteded use of this library is to allow a user to edit a
    text file representation of a look up table which can then be loaded in
    to an embedded controller such as MegaSquirt [http://www.msextra.com].
    Additional code would be needed to convert this generic structure to
    whatever application specific format is required.

    What is a *look up table* and how is it different than a *table*? A
    *look up table* is commonly used in embedded controllers to avoid the
    use of costly floating pointing operations by looking up a value based
    on the input coordiantes. A function with two inputs (f(x, y)) which
    would use floating point operations can be represented (with some loss
    in precsion) as a table.

    In contrast a *table* (or spreadsheet) has any number of columns/rows.
    The columns can be of different types. And a table does not try to
    represent any sort of function, it just stores data.

STRING FORMAT
    The format of the look up table when stored to a string or file should
    look like the example below.

                            rpm
 
                  [1000]   [1500]  [2000]  [2500]
           [100]  14.0     15.5    16.4    17.9
      map  [90]   13.0     14.5    15.3    16.8
           [80]   12.0     13.5    14.2    15.7

    The x (across top) and y (left column) coordinates have there values
    enclosed in square brackets. All values must be present. And the titles
    can only span one line. There can be any number of lines and spaces as
    long as the values can be discerned. When saving and restoring a table
    the original spacing will not be preserved.

    The x values start at offset 0 at the left and increase towards the
    right. The y values start at offset 0 at the bottom and increase upward.

OPERATIONS
  Text::LookUpTable->load($string);
      Returns: a new table object on success, FALSE on error

    Creates a new look up table object by parsing the given string. See the
    section *STRING FORMAT* for details on format it expects.

    If you want to load a table from a *file* see *load_file*.

  Text::LookUpTable->load_file($file)
      Returns: new object on success, FALSE on error

    Works like *load* but obtains the text from the $file first.

    Stores the name of file so that save_file can be used without having to
    specify the file again.

  Text::LookUpTable->load_blank($x_size, $y_size, $x_title, $y_title)
      Returns: new object on success, FALSE on error

    Creates a blank object with all values initialized to zero and
    dimensions of $x_size and $y_size.

  $tbl->as_string();
      Returns string on success, FALSE on error.

    Convert the object to a string representation.

    This operation is used to overload the string operation so the shorthand
    form can be used.

      print $tbl;         # print the object as a string

      $to_save = "$tbl";  # get the string format to be saved

    The long hand form $tbl->as_string(); should not normally be needed.

  $tbl->save_file($file);
      Returns TRUE on success, FALSE on error

    Optional argument $file, can specify the file to save to. If ommitted it
    will save to the last file that was used. If no last file is stored it
    will produce an error.

  $tbl->get_*_coords();
      Returns list of all x/y coordinates on success, FALSE on error

    Offset 0 for the X coordinates start at the LEFT of the displayed table
    and increases RIGHTWARD.

    Offset 0 for the Y coordinates start at the TOP of the displayed table
    and increases DOWNWARD.

      @xs = $tbl->get_x_coords();
      @ys = $tbl->get_y_coords();

  $tbl->set_*_coords(@new_coords);
      Returns TRUE on success, FALSE on error

    Assigns the x/y coordinates to the values given in the list.

      $res = $tbl->set_x_coords(@new_x_coords);
      $res = $tbl->set_y_coords(@new_y_coords);

  $tbl->get_*_vals($offset);
      Returns list of values on success OR FALSE on error

    Retrives all values for a given offset.

     @xs = get_x_vals($y_offset);
     @ys = get_y_vals($x_offset);

    The 0 offset of the returned list will correspond to the 0 offset of the
    displayed table.

  $tbl->set($x, $y, $val);
      Returns TRUE on success OR FALSE on error

    Set the value to $val at the given $x and $y coordinate offset.

  $tbl->get($x, $y);
      Returns $value on success, FALSE on error

    Get the value at the given $x and $y coordinate offset.

  $tb1->diff($tb2, $break);
      Returns TRUE if different, FALSE otherwise.

      If $break is FALSE it returns a list of positions that are different.

    Determines whether the VALUES two tables are different. Does not check
    if the coordinates or the titles are different.

    If $brake is FALSE return a complete list of coordinates that are
    different. If $brake is TRUE it breaks out and returns as soon it is
    found that they are different for a slight performance improvement.

  $tb1->diff_*_coords($tb2)
      Returns list of differences on success, FALSE on error

     @xdiffs = $tb1->diff_x_coords($tb2);
     @ydiffs = $tb1->diff_y_coords($tb2);

  $tbl->as_plot('plot type', [type specific args ...] );
      Returns TRUE on success, FALSE on error.

    Convert the table to a representation suitable for plotting. The string
    may need to be output to a file depending on how the plotting program is
    called.

    See below for the various plot types.

   R  [www.r-project.org]
      Returns: string on success, FALSE on error

    The string can be output to a file and then the file can be sourced to
    produce a plot. It depends upon the rgl library
    [http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rgl/index.html].

     $tbl->as_plot('R');

     user$ a.out > file.R
     user$ R

     > source('file.R')

     (plot displayed)

   WANTED: more plot types: gnuplot, etc
