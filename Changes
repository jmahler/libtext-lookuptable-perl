  [Jeremiah Mahler]
  * Fixed erroneous inclusion of README.pod in to library directory.
    Having README.pod in the main directory results in nice output
    when uploaded to github.com.  But it is erroneously included by
    ExtUtils::MakeMaker in to the lib directory.
    No easy way of overcoming this fault was found.
    See /usr/share/perl/5.10.1/ExtUtils/MM_Unix.pm line 1265
